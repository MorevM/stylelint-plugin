The rule supports different naming conventions for BEM entities by allowing you
to configure the separators between block elements, modifiers, and modifier values.

This flexibility ensures compatibility with all popular BEM styles described in the
official [BEM methodology naming convention](https://en.bem.info/methodology/naming-convention/)
or even custom ones.

#### Available separators

| Option          | Default | Description                                         |
| --------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `element`       | `__`    | Separator between block and element.                |
| `modifier`      | `--`    | Separator between block/element and modifier name.  |
| `modifierValue` | `--`    | Separator between modifier name and modifier value. |
