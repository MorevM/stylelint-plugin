[–ù–∞ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–º —è–∑—ã–∫–µ ‚Üí CONTRIBUTING_RU.md](./CONTRIBUTING_RU.md)

This guide will help you get started smoothly.

## üè≥Ô∏è Language

Russian is acceptable if it helps you express the idea more clearly. \

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development workflow

This project requires **Node.js 22 or higher** and **pnpm v10** for development. \
End-users can install and run the plugin with **Node.js 18 or higher**.

---

### Setup

```bash
pnpm install
```

---

### Common scripts

* **`pnpm prepare`** \
  Runs `generate-meta` and installs Git hooks via [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook). \
  Runs automatically after `pnpm install`.

* **`pnpm test`** \
  Runs the full test suite with [vitest](https://vitest.dev/).

* **`pnpm test:dev`** \
  Starts Vitest in watch mode with a minimal reporter. \
  You can limit the scope to matching files, e.g. `pnpm test:dev no-unused-variables.impl`
  will only run tests from files containing that substring in their path.

* **`pnpm lint`** \
  Runs both ESLint and Stylelint across the codebase. \
  No separate formatter is used. ESLint (with the [Stylistic plugin](https://eslint.style/)) acts as a code formatter.

* **`pnpm lint:fix`** \
  Same as `lint`, but with autofix enabled.

* **`pnpm build`** \
  Generates rule metadata (schemas) and bundles the project.

* **`pnpm docs:dev`** \
  Starts the **VitePress** dev server for documentation.

* **`pnpm docs:build`** \
  Regenerates rule metadata and builds static docs.

* **`pnpm docs:preview`** \
  Runs a local preview of the built docs.

* **`pnpm generate-meta`** \
  Generates rule metadata and schemas from source code.
  This script is invoked before build/docs/release to ensure consistency.

### Editor integration & hooks

* If you use **ESLint extension** in your editor, formatting fixes will be applied automatically on save.
* Pre-commit hooks are installed via [lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook):
  * Commit messages are validated against [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/);
  * Linting runs on staged files to prevent committing invalid code.

## ‚úíÔ∏è Ways to contribute

* Fix a bug
* Improve or add documentation
* Propose a new rule
* Suggest enhancements or options for existing rules
* Improve performance or internal code organization
* Share the project (blog posts, social media)

## ‚úÖ Good practices

* Keep PRs small and focused
* Include minimal **‚ùå incorrect / ‚úÖ correct** code examples
* Update rule docs when behavior changes
* Ensure tests cover both valid and invalid cases
* Discuss breaking changes before implementing
