::: details üß± How the BEM block is determined

Some BEM linters ‚Äî like [postcss-bem-linter](https://github.com/postcss/postcss-bem-linter) ‚Äî
require you to define the block name explicitly using a comment (`/** @define the-component */`)
or derive it from the filename via configuration.

This plugin takes a different, much simpler approach:

---

> **The first class selector in the file is considered the BEM block.**

---

‚úÖ **Why this is enough** \
In a component-oriented architecture, there is rarely a reason to define more than one block per file.
Assuming that the first top-level class represents the component's block is usually both practical and predictable ‚Äî
without requiring additional annotations or configuration. \
It also avoids coupling the rule to naming conventions or file structure.

---

‚ùì **What if you need more control?** \
If your project uses a different structure, this assumption may not work well.

This plugin doesn't currently support custom block resolution logic or in-file annotations ‚Äî
mostly because there's little evidence it's needed. \
But if you have a real use case ‚Äî feel free to open an issue and describe your use case.
